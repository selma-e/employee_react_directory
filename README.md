# Selma's HW19 React Employee Directory

## Description:

In this activity, I am creating an employee directory that utilizes React. The employees are being pulled from the Random User API by thumbnail, first and last name, phone number, email, and date of birth. Every time the page is loaded, 100 different employees will render. In the search bar, I have implemented an OnChange event handler that listens for every change or key entered. For every key entered, the names of the employees will filter based on the string entered. Additionally, I added the functionality of clicking on the full name caret to sort the employees in alphabetical order (ascending and descending). In addition, I organized the API endpoint to only return random users from the United States (to eliminate names appearing in Arabic or Farsi). In the future, I will try to implement sorting other columns in this directory.
